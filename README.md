# quantum-factorization-shors-algorithm
Shor's algorithm using the Quantum Rings Simulator to factor semiprimes of various bit sizes.

This repository implements Shor's Algorithm to factor semiprimes using the Quantum Rings simulator.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- QuantumRingsLib (Quantum Rings API wrapper)

## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Replace the `QR_TOKEN` and `QR_ACCOUNT` variables in the code with your Quantum Rings API credentials.
3. Execute the script: `python quantum_factorization.py`
4. View the output for factorization results.

## Overview of Shor's Algorithm:
Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that efficiently factors large numbers. It uses quantum parallelism to find the period of a modular exponential function, which is used to discover the prime factors of a semiprime number.
