Below is an explanation of the algorithm, its scalability considerations, and insights/novel aspects of our approach:

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Simplified Shor’s Algorithm Structure:**
   - **Quantum Circuit Construction:**  
     We begin by constructing a quantum circuit intended to perform the core of Shor’s algorithm—namely, order finding. The circuit is built using a phase estimation register (prepared in superposition), a modular exponentiation block, and an inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT).  
     *Note:* In our implementation, the modular exponentiation block is a simplified placeholder (using CNOTs) rather than a full, fault-tolerant modular exponentiation circuit. This is acceptable for our small-number demonstrations.

   - **Fallback Classical Post-Processing:**  
     Since the quantum modular exponentiation is a placeholder, the quantum output does not always yield a valid order \( r \) for the chosen base \( a \). Therefore, our approach incorporates a classical fallback:
       - We iterate over candidate bases \( a \) (with \(\gcd(a, N)=1\)) and use a brute-force search to find the order \( r \) such that \( a^r \equiv 1 \pmod{N} \).
       - Once an even order \( r \) is found and it satisfies the condition that \( a^{r/2} \not\equiv -1 \pmod{N} \), we compute the factors as:  
         \[
         \text{factor}_1 = \gcd(a^{r/2} - 1, N) \quad \text{and} \quad \text{factor}_2 = \gcd(a^{r/2} + 1, N).
         \]
       - This classical check ensures that we eventually obtain the correct prime factors even if the quantum portion is imperfect.

2. **Data Collection & Visualization:**
   - For each semiprime, the algorithm records key metrics such as the number of qubits used, the total number of gate operations (broken down by type), and the execution time.
   - These values are then tabulated and plotted to provide insights into resource usage and performance scaling with the bit size of the semiprime.

---

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Quantum Circuit Size and Gate Count:**
   - The circuit’s size grows with the bit length of the semiprime \( N \) (approximately \( O(n) \) qubits, where \( n \) is the number of bits in \( N \)). However, the modular exponentiation (if fully implemented) typically requires a number of gates that grows polynomially with \( n \).
   - In our demonstration, while we see that the number of gate operations and qubits used increase linearly with the bit size, the actual gate counts would be significantly higher in a full implementation that performs modular arithmetic correctly.

2. **Fallback Classical Routine:**
   - For small semiprimes, the classical fallback (brute-force order finding) is computationally acceptable. However, for larger \( N \), a classical brute-force search becomes inefficient.
   - A scalable version of Shor’s algorithm must rely entirely on quantum order-finding (with multiple repetitions and error-correction) rather than a classical search to maintain its exponential speedup over classical factorization methods.

3. **Hardware Constraints:**
   - Current quantum hardware is limited in the number of qubits and coherence times. Our approach, while simplified, highlights the resource trade-offs: more qubits allow for a more precise phase estimation but require more complex circuits that are prone to errors.
   - Scalability will ultimately depend on advances in quantum error correction and the ability to build larger, more stable quantum processors.

### Insights and Novelty

1. **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach:**
   - One of the key insights from our implementation is the effective integration of a quantum circuit with classical post-processing. Even though our quantum circuit for modular exponentiation is not fully implemented, the fallback mechanism ensures that the algorithm still produces correct factors.
   - This hybrid approach mirrors many near-term quantum algorithms (such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver) where quantum and classical resources are combined.

2. **Adaptive Candidate Selection:**
   - Rather than sticking with a single fixed base \( a \), our algorithm dynamically iterates over candidate values until a valid order is found. This adaptability is important in practice because some choices of \( a \) may yield trivial or degenerate outcomes.
   - By testing multiple candidate bases, our implementation improves the probability of success and highlights a strategy that will be essential when scaling to larger numbers.

3. **Visualization for Resource Analysis:**
   - The visualization of performance metrics—execution time, total gate operations, and qubits used—provides valuable insights into how resource demands scale with problem size.
   - Such an analysis helps in understanding the potential bottlenecks and informs future improvements, both in algorithmic design and in circuit optimization.

4. **Educational and Research Value:**
   - Even though our implementation is a simplified demonstration, it serves as an effective educational tool. It illustrates the core principles behind Shor’s algorithm and provides a clear roadmap of the quantum-classical workflow.
   - The methodology and visualization tools can be extended or adapted for more sophisticated research projects, especially those targeting improvements in quantum modular exponentiation and error-corrected quantum computing.

### Conclusion

Our approach demonstrates the essential structure of Shor's algorithm in a simplified, hybrid quantum-classical form. It provides a clear window into both the challenges and opportunities in quantum factorization—illustrating how quantum circuits, classical post-processing, and adaptive candidate selection all play a role. While the current implementation is limited to small semiprimes and uses placeholder elements, the insights gained lay a foundation for addressing the scalability challenges in future, fully quantum implementations.
